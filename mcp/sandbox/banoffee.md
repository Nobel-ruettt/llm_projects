# Banoffee Pie Recipe

## Ingredients
- 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk (for caramel)
- 1 1/2 cups (150g) digestive biscuits or graham cracker crumbs
- 1/3 cup (75g) unsalted butter, melted
- 3-4 ripe bananas
- 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Grated chocolate or cocoa powder for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Make the caramel:** Place the unopened can of sweetened condensed milk in a pot of boiling water, ensuring the can is fully submerged. Boil for about 2 to 3 hours, adding water as needed to keep the can covered. Remove carefully and let it cool completely before opening.

2. **Prepare the crust:** Mix the biscuit crumbs and melted butter in a bowl until combined. Press the mixture firmly into the base of a 9-inch pie dish. Chill in the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.

3. **Slice the bananas:** Peel and slice the bananas evenly and set aside.

4. **Whip the cream:** In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until soft peaks form.

5. **Assemble the pie:** Spread the cooled caramel over the biscuit base. Arrange the banana slices evenly on top of the caramel. Spread the whipped cream over the bananas.

6. **Garnish:** Sprinkle grated chocolate or a dusting of cocoa powder over the top.

7. **Chill:** Refrigerate the pie for at least 1 hour before serving to let it set.
